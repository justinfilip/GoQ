3. Payment and Subscription
One-Time Purchase

Pricing Changes

We reserve the right to change the One-Time Fee and the monthly Premium Subscription fee. Any change in pricing will be communicated in advance through the Application, the mobile app store, or another reasonable channel. Continued use of the Application or Premium Subscription after the effective date of price changes constitutes your agreement to the new pricing.

You violate any term of this Agreement;
You fail to pay required fees;
We discontinue the Application; or
